## Hey,
I am Schleimfresse (roughly translated does it mean something like Slimeface). I am a active League of Legends player, Valorant and a Minecraft player.
In my free time (when I am not gaming) I programm / code around. I mostly code web stuff. I am somewhat skilled in JavaScript and Node stuff. I also, can a little bit of Python.  If you want to see some of my projects click [here](https://github.com/Schleimfresse?tab=repositories).<br>
See you âœŒ :)
