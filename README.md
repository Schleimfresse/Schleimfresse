Hey, I am Schleimfresse (roughly translated does it mean something like Slimeface). I am a active League player and a Minecraft player.
In my free time (when I am not gaming) I programm / code around. I mostly code web stuff. I am somewhat skilled in JavaScript and Node stuff. I also, can a little bit of Python.
See you ✌ :)
